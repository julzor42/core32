# core32
Core32 is a library for PIC32MX 32-bit microcontrollers designed to be small and performant.
It allows to easily control the M4K core and the device's peripherals (SPI, UART, I2C, DMA, ...)

It also embeds few drivers for external peripherals (Wii Nunchuk, 23LC1024 SRAM, IL9341 screen controller, ...)

Core32 was developed as a replacement for the now obsolete Microchip Peripheral Library and to avoid the complexity
of the MPLAB Harmony Framework.
